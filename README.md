## Hi, I'm Sourav 👋

Pre Final year engineering student focused on **backend engineering and system design**.  
I enjoy building scalable services, understanding how systems fail, and designing software that holds up under real-world constraints.

---

### 🚧 What I'm Currently Working On
- Designing backend services with scalability, caching, and rate-limiting in mind
- Building end-to-end web & app systems (API → database → client)
- Exploring production-grade system design patterns

---

### 🧠 Currently Learning
- Distributed system fundamentals (load balancing, replication, sharding)
- Database internals and query optimization
- Designing APIs for scale and reliability

---


### 🧪 Past Experience
- Built full-stack web applications with backend-heavy logic
- Developed mobile apps with real-time data and API integration
- Worked across frontend, backend, and database layers
